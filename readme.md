# Mouse Hover Script

Created by Sidhant

## What This Does

This is a fun little script that makes your mouse move automatically in a small circle. It’s especially useful if you’re using apps like Microsoft Teams, where your status can show "away" if you haven’t moved your mouse for a while. 

With this script, your mouse will always be active, so you won’t appear "away" anymore! This is also great for avoiding any scolding from your boss when they see you're not at your desk. With this script, you can keep your status active while you unleash your creativity.

- **Avoids Awkward Moments**: No more worrying about getting scolded for being "away" during work hours. You'll be always present, yet never really there!
